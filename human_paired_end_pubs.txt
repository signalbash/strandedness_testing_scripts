known interactions"	"In step 2, three one-guide expression cassettes are amplified by PCR and inserted into digested Perturb-seq GBC library in a single reaction by four-piece Gibson assembly;Data for 10 library negative control sgRNAs were randomly chosen for inclusion;These indices are affixed to cDNA molecules during reverse transcription and, after pooled RNA-seq library preparation, are read out with mRNA identity by sequencing;Close proximity of the GBC and the BGH pA within this cassette favors faithful transmission of GBC sequences into single-cell RNA-seq libraries, which typically capture only the 3‰Û_ ends of transcripts;Finally, to ensure robust GBC capture, we developed a PCR protocol to specifically enrich GBC-containing cDNAs, or ‰ÛÏguide-mapping amplicons,‰Û out of single-cell RNA-seq libraries (Figure 1A, 1B);Using our reporter cell line, we separately screened two genome-scale CRISPRi libraries, our first generation library (CRISPRi-v1), which targets 15,977 genes (20,899 transcriptional start sites, TSSs) with 10 sgRNAs per TSS, and our recently described second-generation library (CRISPRi-v2), which targets 18,905 genes (20,526 TSSs) with 5 sgRNAs per TSS (Figures 4C‰ÛÒD, S4B, S4C, Tables S3‰ÛÒ6) (Gilbert et al., 2014; Horlbeck et al., 2016);Briefly, reporter cells (cBA011) transduced with each library were grown for 8 days and then separated into bins according to their ratiometric reporter signal (mCherry/GFP) by FACS;Of the 141 hits from the CRISPRi-v1 screen, 103 reproduced from screening the CRISPRi-v2 library (Fisher‰Ûªs Exact p-value = 8.97e-138) (Figure S4B).;Next, to characterize the role of these different gene classes we applied Perturb-seq to a small CRISPRi library of 91 sgRNAs targeting 82 genes, including many of our strongest hits, and 2 negative controls (Figure S4B, Table S1);A random 18-nt barcode was then inserted between the BFP and BGH polyA sequences (using subsequently disrupted EcoRI and AvrII sites) by Gibson assembly to construct the ‰ÛÏPerturb-seq GBC library‰Û (pBA571, Addgene, Cat#85968);This library was prepared with an estimated barcode diversity of >100,000 essentially as previously described (Kampmann et al., 2014);Guide RNA protospacer sequences were individually cloned into both the original sgRNA expression vector and the pBA571 library (between the BstXI and BlpI sites) by ligation;Three-guide expression cassettes were then assembled from PCR-amplified single cassettes and inserted into HpaI/XhoI-digested pBA571 (Perturb-seq GBC library) by a single four-piece Gibson assembly step;To account for varied effects on cell viability across the sgRNA sub-library and minimize cell number difference at final evaluation, pooling titers were determined by the percentage of BFP+ cells remaining 6 days post transduction;The lentivirus library pool was then used to infect cBA010 cells (performed by spinfection at 33å¡C for 3 hours at 1000ÌÑg) so that a single pooled cell population with all perturbations would be carried though subsequent steps;For all Perturb-seq experiments, single-cell RNA-seq libraries were prepared according to the Single Cell 3‰Û_ Reagent Kits User Guide (10X Genomics);However, this protocol produces libraries that are not compatible with analysis on the HiSeq 4000 Sequencing System (Illumina) due to the presence of unique byproducts;To remove this issue, we implemented a short, post-preparation library cleanup protocol;Specifically, 120‰ÛÒ200 ng of library material was split into parallel PCR reactions containing 0.3 ë_M each of the Illumina P5 and P7 primers, and amplified using Kapa HiFi ReadyMix according to the following protocol: (1) 95å¡C for 80 seconds, (2) 98å¡C for 20 seconds, then 65å¡C for 30 seconds, then 72å¡C for 20 seconds (6 cycles), (3) 72å¡C for 1 minute;For the UPR epistasis experiment, the library for each drug condition was sequenced using two HiSeq 4000 lanes;For the UPR Perturb-seq experiment, each of the 10 Chromium libraries was sequenced using 1.5 HiSeq 4000 lanes (one dedicated lane each plus half of a lane shared with another library);Parallel PCR reactions were constructed containing 30 ng of final library as template, 0.6 ë_M PTMN050-P7 (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT), and 0.6 ë_M barcoded PTMN051 (AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC [ILLUMINA S513‰ÛÒS522 INDEX] TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACCTCCCTAGCAAACTGGG GCACAAG), and amplified using Kapa HiFi ReadyMix according to the following PCR protocol: (1) 95å¡C for 3 minutes, (2) 98å¡C for 15 seconds, then 70å¡C for 10 seconds (14‰ÛÒ16 cycles);Guide barcode libraries were sequenced either as spike-ins alongside the parent RNA-seq libraries (pilot experiment and UPR epistasis experiment) or using half of a separate HiSeq 2500 rapid run (UPR Perturb-seq experiment).;The CRISPRi-v1 (Addgene, Cat#62217) or the compact (5 sgRNA/gene) CRISPRi-v2 (Addgene, Cat#83969) sgRNA libraries were transduced into cBA011 cells at an MOI < 1 (BFP+ cell percentages were ~45% and 26%, respectively);Approximately 23‰ÛÒ30 million cells were collected per bin during screening of the CRISPRi-v1 library (a representation of ~450) and 19‰ÛÒ22 million cells per bin for CRISPRi-v2 (a representation of ~600);Practically, the more compact CRISPRi-v2 library allowed us to maintain higher screen representation through the flow cytometer with similar sorting times;Reporter phenotypes for library sgRNAs were calculated as the log2 enrichment of sgRNA sequences identified within the high mCherry/GFP cells over the low mCherry/GFP cells (Table S6);All analysis was performed in Python, using a combination of Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and a custom-made Perturb-seq library;Specifically amplified guide barcode libraries were created as described above and either sequenced as spike-ins or independently;These reads were aligned using bowtie (flags: -v2 -q -m1) to a library of expected GBC sequences;In the UPR Perturb-seq experiment, the mixed population was run in ten separate pools that were treated independently during library preparation (corresponding to lanes on the 10X Chromium instrument and on the Illumina sequencer);In step 2, three one-guide expression cassettes are amplified by PCR and inserted into digested Perturb-seq GBC library in a single reaction by four-piece Gibson assembly;Data for 10 library negative control sgRNAs were randomly chosen for inclusion;National Library of Medicine                                      8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda
